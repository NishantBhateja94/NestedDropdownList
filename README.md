DndContext manages drag state.

SortableContext + useSortable makes each item draggable.

Recursive <List> renders children inside nested SortableContexts.

onDragOver handles moving between levels:

Removes item from old location.

Inserts into targetâ€™s children.

Prevents moving into own descendants.
